**High-Level Plan for Adding a “Vault” Tab with File Viewing and Creation**

Below is a **textual overview** that describes how to implement a second tab called “Vault” in your existing web application. This new tab will allow you to browse a `vault/` directory on the server, open files to view their contents on the right side of the screen, and create new files/folders within the vault.

---

### 1. Two Tabs in the Left Sidebar

- At the top of the sidebar (where you currently display conversations), introduce **two “tabs”**:  
  1. **Conversations** – The existing view that shows previous chats.  
  2. **Vault** – A new view to display the folder structure of the `vault` directory.

- Visually, these tabs should appear as two buttons or labels. When “Conversations” is active, it highlights that tab; when “Vault” is selected, it highlights the other tab.

- Keep an internal state or variable (for example, `currentTab`) to know which tab the user is currently on. If `currentTab` is set to “conversations,” your existing conversation list is shown. If it is set to “vault,” the folder structure for the vault is shown.

### 2. Switching Between Tabs

- When the user **clicks** the **Conversations** tab:
  1. Set your internal state to indicate you’re in “conversations” mode.  
  2. Display the conversation list on the left, as you do now.  
  3. Show any relevant buttons for that mode (for example, the **“+ New”** button that starts a new conversation).  
  4. Hide or remove any Vault-specific content in the sidebar.

- When the user **clicks** the **Vault** tab:
  1. Set your internal state to indicate you’re in “vault” mode.  
  2. Replace the conversation list with a directory listing of the `vault/` folder.  
  3. Hide the conversation “+ New” button, and instead display buttons for creating a new file or folder in the vault.  
  4. Fetch the **directory structure** of `vault/` from the server, then render it.

### 3. Rendering the Vault Directory

- On the server, prepare an **endpoint** that returns a list (or tree) describing the files and folders in `vault/`. Each item might include:  
  - The **name** of the file or folder (for example, “example.md” or “folder1”).  
  - The **path** (for instance, “example.md” or “folder1/subfolder”).  
  - The **type** of item: “file” or “directory.”  
  - If it’s a directory, a **list of children** (nested objects) representing its subfolders and files.

- When the **Vault tab** is clicked, your front-end calls that endpoint. It receives the JSON representation of the vault’s folder structure and then displays it in the sidebar in a **GitHub-like** style:
  - Folders can be shown with a folder icon or label.  
  - Files can be shown with a file icon or label.  
  - Users can click on an item to either expand the folder to see its contents or open a file.

### 4. Displaying File Content on the Right

- Once the user **clicks** on a **file** in the vault’s folder listing, you retrieve the file content from the server. This might use a **separate endpoint** (for example, `GET /api/vault-file?path=<filepath>`), which returns the file text.

- On the right side of the page, where you normally see the chat conversation, you now display this file content. Visually:
  - If the user is in “Vault” mode, the chat components might be hidden or replaced with a simple text area or a read-only text block that shows the file’s content.  
  - If you want to **edit** the file, you could place the content into a text box for editing and saving.  
  - If you only need to **view** it, a read-only panel can suffice.

---

### 5. Adding “Create Folder” / “Create File” Options

- In the Vault tab, provide **buttons** or **links** (for example, “+ New File” and “+ New Folder”).  
- When the user clicks “+ New File,” you might prompt them to enter the file name (e.g., “notes.md”). The front-end then tells the server to create that empty file in `vault/` (via a POST request).  
- When the user clicks “+ New Folder,” you similarly prompt them for a folder name (e.g., “docs”), and the server creates a corresponding directory within `vault/`.

- After creating a new file or folder, you **refresh** the vault’s directory listing so the user sees the changes immediately.

---

### 6. Putting It All Together

1. **Tab Buttons**: Two clickable labels, “Conversations” and “Vault,” placed at the top of the sidebar. Clicking each updates an internal state.  
2. **Conversation Mode**:  
   - Shows the conversation list in the sidebar.  
   - Displays the existing “+ New” conversation button.  
   - Retains the familiar “chat” window on the right.  
3. **Vault Mode**:  
   - Replaces the sidebar content with the list of folders/files from `vault/`.  
   - Shows “+ New File” and “+ New Folder” options, which create items in `vault/`.  
   - Clicking on a file from the vault displays its content on the right side of the page, **instead** of the chat interface.  
4. **Server Endpoints**:  
   - One endpoint to provide a **recursive directory listing** for the vault.  
   - One endpoint to return **file content** for a selected file.  
   - One endpoint to **create** new files.  
   - One endpoint to **create** new folders.

With these features in place, you’ll have a seamless two-tab interface: the traditional “Conversations” experience and a new “Vault” experience for browsing, viewing, and creating files.
